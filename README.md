# Computational Applications to Policy and Strategy

The CAPS AI Policy and Strategy skills course is an immersive six-part seminar that trains participants in the role of a fictional Forward-Deployed Policy Engineer tasked with overseeing AI systems deployed in an ongoing conflict zone. 

The course begins with an AI bootcamp and quickly moves participants “into the field” to confront case studies rooted in real needs in the test environment of Afghanistan.
