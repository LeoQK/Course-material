# Computational Applications to Policy and Strategy

The CAPS AI Policy and Strategy skills course is an immersive six-part seminar that trains participants
in the role of a fictional Forward-Deployed Policy Engineer tasked with overseeing AI systems deployed in
an ongoing conflict zone. It begins with an AI bootcamp and quickly moves participants “into the field”
to confront case studies rooted in real needs in the test environment of Afghanistan.
